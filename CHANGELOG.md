# Change Log

### [0.0.7]
- Added !seo on yaml to produce a list of properties specifically for SEO. learn more about [Docusaurus Seo](https://docusaurus.io/docs/seo)
- Added bold, italic, and code that is "selected text key binding" enabled. Please see README.md for keybindings under Requirements.
- Fixed formatting for Tab snippets, old one didn't work if you added a codeblock inside the Tab Item.

Properly adding version notes to CHANGELOG.md instead of README.md
