# Markdown Snippets for MDX and Docusaurus README

This is a VSCode extension snippet inspired by my laziness in not memorizing markdown symbols for Docusaurus with MDX.

## Features

Typing '!' in a .md/.mdx file gives you access to snippets like: !codeblock, !fmatter, !fmatter-sidebar, !admo, among [others](#list-of-snippets).

**Bold**, `Code` and *Italics* are also enabled to work with [Selected Text Keybinding](#keybindings-on-selected-text-support).

üî•**New**üî• `!link` now works with selected text keybinding. The text you highlight will be enclosed inside the `[]`.

## List of Snippets
- **!codeblock**: codeblock with language option and title tab stops
- **!link**: made use of this snippet, It now works with selected text [keybinding](#keybindings-on-selected-text-support).
- **!fmatter**: snippet for the front matter with slug, title, authors, tags properties
- **!fmatter-sidebar**: snippet for the front matter with sidebar_label, and sidebar_position properties

I also added a yaml.code-snippets so !authors would work

- **!seo**: all SEO related front matter properties described here [Docusaurus SEO](https://docusaurus.io/docs/seo)

## Requirements

### MDX Support

This extension should work with .md files out of the box. For .mdx files, you would need to make file associations. To do that, simply click on the Plain Text at the bottom right of vs code and then '*Configure File Association for .mdx*'. Search for Markdown then you should be all set!

To make it easier for you, here's the relevant *settings.json* configuration:
```json title='settings.json'
"editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "comments": "inline",
    "strings": "inline"
},
"[markdown]": {
    "editor.quickSuggestions": {
        "other": "on",
        "comments": "inline",
        "strings": "inline"
    }
},
"files.associations": {
    "*.mdx": "markdown"
}
```
### Keybindings on Selected Text Support
I also wanted **Bold**, `Code`, and *Italics* to work with selected text keybinding. So you can add this to your **keybindings.json** and update the keybinding to whatever you prefer.

```json title='keybindings.json'
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+b",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
        "langId": "markdown",
        "name": "Markdown Bold Selected Text"
    }
},
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+c",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
        "langId": "markdown",
        "name": "Markdown Code Selected Text"
    }
},
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+i",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
        "langId": "markdown",
        "name": "Markdown Italic Selected Text"
    }
},
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+l",
    "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
    "when": "editorTextFocus",
    "args": {
        "langId": "markdown",
        "name": "Markdown Link Selected Text"
    }
}
```

## Installation

VS Code Market Place: [Markdown Snippets for MDX and Docusaurus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MisterMunchkin.simple-markdown-snippets)

## Known Issues

There's no way to add keybindings directly onto the snippet extension. So you need to add the keybindings.json mentioned above to use the selected text keybindings.

**Current Supported Keybindings**
- **Bold**
- *Italic*
- `Code`
- [Link](#keybindings-on-selected-text-support)
